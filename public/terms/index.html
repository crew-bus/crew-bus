                <h3>2.1 Open Source License</h3>
                <p>The core crew-bus software is released under the MIT License. You may use, copy, modify, and distribute it freely under the terms of that license.</p>

                <h3>2.2 Security Guard Module</h3>
                <p>The Security Guard module is a paid add-on. Upon purchase of a $29 one-time activation, you receive a perpetual license to use the Guard module with your crew-bus installation. This license is non-transferable and for personal or organizational use.</p>

                <h3>2.3 No Warranty</h3>
                <p>The software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose. You use the software at your own risk.</p>
