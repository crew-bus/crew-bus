        <h1>About crew-bus</h1>
        <p class="legal-updated">The soft takeoff philosophy</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>AI agents are multiplying. Every tool, every platform, every SaaS product is adding agents. But nobody built the infrastructure to organize them.</p>
        <p>Without structure, agents compete for your attention. Without hierarchy, they bypass each other. Without awareness of your energy, they burn you out. The agent revolution shouldn't come at the cost of the human running the show.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>crew-bus is a message bus — free, open-source, local-first — that organizes your AI agents into a crew with a chain of command.</p>
        <p>One human at the top. Always. A Crew Boss (AI Chief of Staff) sits between you and every other agent. It filters noise, prioritizes what matters, and learns your preferences. Trust slider from 1 (it asks about everything) to 10 (it handles almost everything autonomously).</p>

        <h2>The Soft Takeoff</h2>
        <p>We believe in soft takeoff — not the sci-fi kind. The kind where humans gradually delegate more to AI, at their own pace, with guardrails they control.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trust is earned, not assumed.</strong> Your Crew Boss starts at trust level 1 and earns its way up through decisions you approve.</li>
            <li><strong>Burnout is real.</strong> The system tracks your energy and queues non-urgent messages when you're running hot.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy is non-negotiable.</strong> Private sessions are logged as events, never content. Your data stays on your machine.</li>
            <li><strong>The chain of command is enforced.</strong> No agent bypasses the hierarchy unless you explicitly allow it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Free Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>The core bus — message routing, hierarchy enforcement, trust-based autonomy, burnout awareness, quiet hours, multi-channel delivery, briefings, private sessions, team mailbox, dashboard, CLI — is free forever. MIT License. No cloud required.</p>
        <p>The Security Guard module ($29 one-time) adds anomaly detection and threat monitoring. Installer permits ($25 each, first free) let verified professionals sell their services on the marketplace.</p>

        <h2>Built for Everyone</h2>
        <p>The hierarchy pattern is universal. An individual running 5 personal AI agents uses the same architecture as an enterprise with 50 agents across departments. Only the YAML config changes.</p>
        <p>If you can edit a YAML file, you can run a crew. If you can't, find an installer.</p>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>crew-bus is MIT licensed. Fork it. Modify it. Run it on your own hardware. No telemetry. No cloud accounts. No vendor lock-in.</p>
