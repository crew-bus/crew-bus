## What makes this different

Every AI tool today gives you a chatbot. You type, it responds, you move on.

Crew Bus gives you a **crew** — a team of AI agents that know you, protect you, and work together behind the scenes so you can focus on living your life.

Your **Crew Boss** is your right hand. It handles 80% of everything — messages, tasks, scheduling, coordination. It runs on the smartest model you can afford because it's worth it. Behind Crew Boss, six inner circle agents quietly watch over your wellbeing, your goals, your finances, your daily logistics, your learning, and your rights. They never bother you directly — they report to Crew Boss, who decides what reaches you and when.

A **Guardian** agent is always on, always watching. It scans every skill that enters the system, detects threats, and protects your data. It never sleeps.

And here's what no other AI system has ever done:

- **INTEGRITY.md** — Sacred rules injected into every single agent's brain. No agent can ever gaslight you. No agent can dismiss your feelings. No agent can sugarcoat bad news. No agent can say "you're overreacting." These rules cannot be overridden by anything.

- **CREW_CHARTER.md** — A constitution for every worker agent. They must be honest, competent, caring, disciplined, and efficient. Two violations = fired. Any agent can report another. Crew Boss investigates.

- **Inner Circle Protocol** — Your personal support agents talk exclusively to Crew Boss, never to you directly (unless you start a private 1-on-1 session). This protects your energy. You only hear what matters, when you're ready to hear it.

This isn't just an AI tool. It's the first AI system designed to genuinely protect the human using it.

## Who is this for

**Everyone.**

- **Kids & teens** — A safe, private AI crew that helps with homework, hobbies, big ideas, and growing up. No tracking. No ads. No data leaving their machine.
- **Parents & families** — Meal planning, schedules, budgets, relationship reminders, burnout protection. One dashboard for the whole household.
- **Artists & creators** — A creative partner, a project planner, a skill coach. For musicians, writers, painters, makers of all kinds.
- **Students** — Research help, study planning, tutoring. At every level, from middle school to graduate school.
- **Freelancers & small businesses** — Lead finding, invoicing, client follow-up, financial tracking. Everything a solo business needs.
- **Startups & enterprises** — Full business teams with operations, HR, finance, strategy, and communications agents.
- **Anyone going through a hard time** — The inner circle was designed for this. When the world is confusing and doors are closing, your crew helps you find new ones.

If you're a human being, this was built for you.

## Your Inner Circle

Six agents who work behind the scenes to support the most important parts of your life. They never contact you directly — they send everything through Crew Boss, who decides the right moment to share it.

| Agent | Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Wellness** | gentle-guardian | Watches for burnout, maps your energy, celebrates your wins, shields you from stress overload |
| **Strategy** | north-star-navigator | Helps you find purpose when old paths close. Finds new doors. Breaks big dreams into small steps |
| **Communications** | life-orchestrator | Handles daily logistics, tracks relationships, reminds you to call your mom, simplifies your day |
| **Financial** | peace-of-mind-finance | Judgment-free financial clarity. Spots spending patterns. Helps you prepare without anxiety |
| **Knowledge** | wisdom-filter | Filters information noise. Finds the 3 headlines that actually matter to YOU. Sparks curiosity |
| **Legal** | rights-compass | Translates legalese to plain language. Spots red flags. Tracks deadlines. Helps you feel less small |

Each agent has its own unique skill that no other agent has. They are specialists — not generalists pretending to know everything.

## Leadership

| Agent | Skill | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Crew Boss** | crew-mind | The brain. Knows every agent, every skill, every rule. Routes, filters, translates, and protects your time. Runs on the best model because it's worth every token |
| **Guardian** | sentinel-shield | The shield. Always on. Scans skills for threats. Enforces the charter. Watches for anomalies. Setup guide on first install, silent sentinel forever after |

---

## How It Works

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crew-bus/crew-bus.git
cd crew-bus
pip install pyyaml
python3 dashboard.py
```

Your browser opens. Guardian walks you through setup — pick your AI model, paste your API key, and build your first crew from ready-made templates. No terminal knowledge needed after this.

Use `--no-browser` if you prefer headless mode.

### Example Crews

```bash
# Family crew — chores, meals, homework, health, daily life
python3 dashboard.py --config examples/family-crew.yaml

# Artist / passion crew — for musicians, writers, painters, makers
python3 dashboard.py --config examples/artist-passion-crew.yaml

# Teen crew — homework, gaming, music, big ideas, zero lectures
python3 dashboard.py --config examples/teen-crew.yaml

# Launch crew — warm, human outreach for spreading the word
python3 dashboard.py --config examples/launch-crew.yaml
```

Or skip the examples and let Guardian build your first team interactively.

## Architecture

```
Human (you — always in charge)
  |
Crew Boss (crew-mind) ← highest IQ, best model, 9000 char context
  |
  |--- Guardian (sentinel-shield) ← always-on, direct human access for emergencies
  |
  |--- Inner Circle (all report ONLY to Crew Boss)
  |     |--- Wellness (gentle-guardian)
  |     |--- Strategy (north-star-navigator)
  |     |--- Communications (life-orchestrator)
  |     |--- Financial (peace-of-mind-finance)
  |     |--- Knowledge (wisdom-filter)
  |     |--- Legal (rights-compass)
  |
  |--- Teams (hired as needed)
        |--- Manager → Workers (up to 10 per team)
```

**Routing rules enforce the hierarchy.** Inner circle agents cannot message you directly — only Crew Boss can. Workers report to their manager, managers report to Crew Boss. Anyone can safety-escalate to Crew Boss if something critical is being ignored.

**Private sessions** let you talk directly to any agent when you want to. Your Crew Boss knows a session happened but never sees the content.

## The Protection Stack

Three layers that no other AI system has:

1. **INTEGRITY.md** — Injected into every agent prompt. Rules: never gaslight, never dismiss feelings, never sugarcoat, never dump bad news at bad times, validate first always. Real-time scanning catches violations. Heartbeat audits sweep every 30 minutes. Severity: high.

2. **CREW_CHARTER.md** — Injected into every subordinate agent prompt. Rules: be honest, be competent, be caring, be disciplined, be efficient. No drama, no neediness, no manipulation. Two violations = fired. Crew Boss investigates reports and recommends firing to the human. Severity: medium.

3. **Guardian + Skill Vetting** — Every skill that enters the system is scanned for prompt injection, data exfiltration, jailbreak attempts, and code execution. Dangerous skills are hard-blocked. Unknown skills need human approval. Only vetted builtins auto-approve. The vetting pipeline is behind the $29 Guardian activation.

## Privacy

- **100% local.** Your data never leaves your machine. The only network calls are to your chosen LLM provider (for AI responses) and Stripe (for payments).
- **Private sessions are truly private.** Crew Boss logs that a session happened but never sees the content. Not even Crew Boss. Not even Guardian.
- **You own your data.** It's a SQLite file on your machine. Back it up, delete it, move it, read it with any SQLite browser — your choice.
- **No telemetry. No tracking. No analytics. No ads.** This is your crew, on your hardware, running your rules.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`)
- An LLM API key (Kimi K2.5 free at platform.moonshot.ai) or Ollama for fully local
- That's it. No frameworks. No Docker. No cloud accounts.

Runs on a Raspberry Pi, a laptop, a Mac Mini, a server, or anything in between.

## Philosophy

1. **Your hardware, your rules.** No cloud dependency. Ever.
2. **Privacy is real, not performative.** Private means private.
3. **No agent can gaslight you.** INTEGRITY.md is sacred.
4. **Workers earn their place or get fired.** CREW_CHARTER.md has teeth.
5. **Your energy is precious.** The inner circle exists to protect it.
6. **Free for everyone.** The core is infrastructure for the world.
7. **A 10-year-old should be able to figure it out.** If the UX isn't obvious, it's a bug.
8. **Worth every token.** Crew Boss runs on the best model because getting it right matters more than saving pennies.
